# Code for: Global groundwater system archetypes

This is the code repository associated with the manuscript: Huggins et al. (2023). Global groundwater system archetypes: Development of a novel groundwater typology based on socioeconomic, ecological, and Earth system functions Preprint available at: https://doi.org/10.31223/X5M382

### Objective: Produce a set of global archetypes that reflect patterns in groundwater's socioeconomic, ecological, and Earth system functions
- Derives groundwater system archetypes using sequenced self-organising maps
- Calcaulates basic summary statistics of the archetypes
- Calculates common landscape metrics of the archetypes within the major aquifer systems of the world
<br/>


**Repository structure**: <br/>
- `run_all.R`: an overview script that sources scripts in sequential order and is intended to give an overview of the respository structure. 
- scripts: folder containing all other scripts
- [datasources.md](https://github.com/XanderHuggins/gcs-archetypes/blob/main/datasources.md) : documentation and web-links to all data used in this study.
<br/>


Additional scripts, such as plotting scripts, can be made available upon request.
