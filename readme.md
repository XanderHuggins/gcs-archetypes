# Code for: Global groundwater system archetypes

This is the code repository associated with the manuscript: Huggins et al. (2023). Global groundwater system archetypes: Development of a novel groundwater typology based on socioeconomic, ecological, and Earth system functions Preprint available at: [url_here]

### Objective: Produce a set of global archetypes that reflect patterns in groundwater's socioeconomic, ecological, and Earth system functions
-  Derive groundwater archetypes
- Calculate landscape metrics of the archetype distribution, both globally and within the major aquifer systems of the world
<br/>


**Repository structure**: <br/>
- `run_all.R`: an overview script that sources all necessary scripts in sequential order 
- scripts: folder containing all other scripts
- [datasources.md](https://github.com/XanderHuggins/gcs-archetypes/blob/main/datasources.md) : documentation and web-links to all data used in this study.
<br/>


Additional scripts, such as plotting scripts, can be made available upon request.
